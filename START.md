# ✅ Site is Working!

The GrowthLab website is now loading successfully!

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/arulv97/growthlab
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at:
- **http://localhost:3000** (if port is free)
- Or the port shown in the terminal output

## If Port 3000 is Busy

The server will automatically use the next available port. Check the terminal output for the actual URL.

## What's Working

✅ **PostCSS & Tailwind CSS** - Fully configured and processing  
✅ **All Components** - Navbar, Hero, Features, Community, Benefits, About, Footer  
✅ **Animations** - Framer Motion animations are active  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes  
✅ **Brand Colors** - Teal (#0f7377) is properly applied  

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Kill existing processes:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   ```

2. **Clear cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. **Start fresh:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Next Steps

- Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown)
- Test all pages: `/login`, `/register`
- Customize content as needed

**The platform is ready! 🎉**
